      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be apt for my first SCCM post to talk about the first Microsoft KB that me and my team had created.
It was &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4465865/software-updates-do-not-download-in-configmgr-if-wsus-is-disconnected&#34;&gt;KB4465865&lt;/a&gt;.
We were upto date with our SCCM install (Current Branch 1806) so we were able to get the Microsft engineering team to make a hot fix for us. It took many hours on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
